# Java Forest Height Analyzer
This program generates a forest and assigns random heights to each tree based on a given age. It then analyzes the forest and assigns color codes to each tree depending on its height.

## How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred IDE.
Run the program.
Enter the desired length and width of the forest when prompted.
The forest will be displayed as a 2D array of characters.
Enter the desired age of the forest when prompted.
The heights of each tree will be displayed as a 2D array of doubles.
Each tree will be color-coded based on its height, with red indicating a height between 0 and 10, yellow indicating a height between 10 and 55, orange indicating a height between 55 and 80, and green indicating a height between 80 and 100.
